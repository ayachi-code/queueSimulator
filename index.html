        <h1>Stacks: A Fundamental Data Structure</h1>
        <h4>In the realm of computer science and programming, a stack is a fundamental data structure that follows the Last-In, First-Out <b>(LIFO)</b> principle. <br> It supports two core operations: push, which adds an item to the top of the stack, and pop, which removes and returns the top item. Think of it like a stack of plates, where you add and remove from the top. <br> Stacks are used for tasks like managing function calls, tracking browser history, and memory management, making them a crucial concept for software developers. Visualizing stacks with simulators helps understand their dynamic nature and utility in various applications.</h4>
        <h1>The Stack Simulator</h1>
        <h4>To utilize the stack simulator, click the "push" button to add random integers (between 1 and 100) to the stack, which are visually represented as colorful rectangles on the canvas.<br> Click the "pop" button to remove elements, and the topmost element will disappear. Clicking the "top" button will display an alert revealing the value of the element at the stack's top without removing it. <br> Please note that the stack size is visually limited to the canvas width (1000 pixels) and can hold up to ten elements, after which an alert will indicate that the stack is full.<br> This interactive simulator offers a visual demonstration of stack operations, making it an excellent learning tool for comprehending stack behavior through hands-on exploration.</h4>
