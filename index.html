        <h1>Stacks: A Fundamental Data Structure</h1>
        <h4>In the world of computer science and programming, a stack is a fundamental data structure that follows the Last-In, First-Out <b>(LIFO)</b> principle. <br> It supports two core operations: push, which adds an item to the top of the stack, and pop, which removes and returns the top item. Think of it like a stack of plates, where you add and remove from the top. <br> Stacks are used for tasks like managing function calls, tracking browser history, and memory management, making them a crucial concept for software developers. Visualizing stacks with simulators helps understand their dynamic nature and utility in various applications.</h4>
        <h1>The Stack Simulator</h1>
        <h4>The Stack Simulator provides an interactive way to understand stack data structures. To use it, click the "push" button to add randomly generated integers (ranging from 1 to 100) to the stack, which are represented as colorful rectangles on the canvas.<br> If you want to remove elements, click the "pop" button, and the topmost element will disappear. Clicking "top" displays an alert revealing the value of the top element without removing it. Keep in mind that the stack's visual size is limited to the canvas width (1000 pixels) and can accommodate up to ten elements;<br> if you exceed this limit, you'll receive an alert indicating that the stack is full. This interactive simulator offers a hands-on approach to grasping stack operations visually, making it an excellent tool for learning about stack behavior.<br> <br> Furthermore, the Stack Simulator offers a visual representation of memory addresses on the right side of the canvas. These memory addresses are displayed in hexadecimal format (e.g., "0x1028"). As you add elements to the stack, you'll notice that these memory addresses decrease by 4 for each new element. This feature helps users understand the concept of memory allocation in a stack data structure, where each element is assigned a unique address in memory. </h4>
